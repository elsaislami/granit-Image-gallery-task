 ## Coding Challenge

 ## Goal

Build a single page web app that allows the user to search and view images
Time limit
Please do not spend significantly more than 5 hours in total, and send the submission within 24 hours of receiving it.
Description
John is researching some images for his own project. He enters his keyword in a search field. The app connects to an image search API and displays the result associated with his research in a tasteful manner and paginated. He can then scroll over the results and click on individual images to bring them in full screen for a great viewing experience. The user should have the ability to switch between different Image provider APIs if they are unable to find what they are looking for. The two APIs we are going to use are from Imgur and Pexels.

 ## Instructions

Treat this challenge as if you were part of the team. Feel free to ask questions if you are completely stuck or use any of your favourite resources such as 3rd party SDKs/libraries, Google, Stack Overflow, etc (Not ChatGPT ).
Additionally, anything that makes the app fast, effortless, delightful and responsive is welcome. Imagine that you are delivering a consumer facing feature.
